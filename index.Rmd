Before getting started with the first lesson, please follow the instructions on the [R Setup][Setup Instructions] to make sure you have all the necessary software installed on your computer.

## Navigating this site {.unnumbered}

The table of contents on the left allows you to navigate to the lesson for each week of the course. Each lesson will walk you through working through the topic, analysis, etc. for that week with exercises at the end of the lesson that will be that week's homework assignment.

Homework will be submitted through Canvas and exercise questions (including any code, figures, etc.) must be submitted in Word or PDF format. The Intro to R lesson will walk through how to create R Markdown documents in R, which you will use to write your code/answers to the exercises and then render to either Word or PDF report which is what you will submit through Canvas.
